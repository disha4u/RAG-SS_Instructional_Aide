# RAG-SS_Instructional_Aide

These are scripts to automate answering and grading module surveys for CSE545: Software Security for which I was an Instructional Aide. 

<p>The <strong>"Survey_Answers.ipynb"</strong> script is for automatically generating answers to survey questions. Here we use models like gemini, openai and a RAG for generating answers to questions asked by students in the module survey which was conducted at end of each module. </p>

<p>The <strong>"Survey_Grader.ipynb"</strong> script is for automatically survey questions for Software Security, one of the key tasks I had to do as an Instructional Aide for the subject. Here we use a basic minimum length check and quantized LLAMA model for verifying the answers. </p>
