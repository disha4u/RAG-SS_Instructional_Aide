# RAG-SS_Instructional_Aide

These are scripts to automate answering and grading module surveys for CSE545: Software Security for which I was an Instructional Aide. <br />

The "Survey_Answers.ipynb" script is for automatically generating answers to survey questions. Here we use models like gemini, openai and a RAG for generating answers to questions asked by students in the module survey which was conducted at end of each module.
