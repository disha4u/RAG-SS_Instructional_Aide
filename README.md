# RAG-SS_Instructional_Aide

These are scripts to automate answering and grading module surveys for CSE545: Software Security for which I was an Instructional Aide. <br />

The Survey_Answers.ipynb script is for automatically generating answers to survey questions for Software Security, one of the key tasks I had to do as an Instructional Aide for the subject. Here we use models like gemini, openai and a RAG for generating answers to questions asked by students in a survey.
